                <p> Dana's greedy halfsiblings' feeble atempt of robbing her of her inheritance fell flat and Dana was know aware of how truly cunning they were. She decided that they didn't deserve to be apart of her life and cuts them off. They showed no remorse, they didn't even bother to apologize to Dana.

                However, all this changed when the lawyers informed them that their action forfieted them from the will. Their father was a very strict and hated when his children disobeyed him, something they did quite often. He was also quite aware of how spoilt and greedy they could be and suspected that they would find away to swindle Dana out of her inheritance. In the will, he put a strict NO-CONTEST clause which concluded that should anyone contest his wishes, they forfeit their share inheritance to charity.

                To their horror they lose all their inheritance, luck for them they still have their trust fund money to live off of. However, it bothers them even more that Dana gets everything. This motivates them even more to ruin her. If they couldn't get any of the estate then they definitely won't stand for Dana to get it. They make another plan to get Dana to lose her inheritance as well.

                They appealed to Dana's good conscience and guilt her into helping out the step mother. Knowing that Dana, was unaware of the NO-CONTEST clause, due to it being apart of the lawyer's NO-DISCLOSURE. Fortunatley for them when they attempted to put their plan into motion, they were informed that Dana had beat them to it. Once Dana found out of their deceit, she went back to the step mother and helped her to get a share of the estate. Thrilled, they just by and watch as Dana's own generousity ruin her.

                It didn't take long for the lawyers to inform Dana of her lost of her inheritance. Unfortunately for her, she had not trustfunf to fall back on like her siblings. Her siblings took such delight in Dana and the stepmother losing everything that they didn't even care about their lost anymore. The selfish half siblings decided to celebrate by taking a trip away on their private jet. </p>
