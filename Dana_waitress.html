                <p> Dana decides to become a waitressing job to make money. However, right away she hates it. She hate the unpredictable hours, sometimes she would work late into the am. She would work so many hours that she would hardly have time to study. And after all the countless hours she still didnt even have enough money to show for it.

                Dana's friend tried multiple times to tempt her to get into trying to be ana escort again and again. Dana would always turn her down but 1 particular night after being hassled by some customers she decided to give a go. </p>
