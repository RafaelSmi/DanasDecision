                <p> Dana Jane Anderson is a brilliant young woman in her early 20s. She attendS Oxford University on a partial scholarship. Her mother's only child, she grew up in a single parent home after her parents divorced when she was 4. She barely remembers what her father looks like and her mother made sure of it. He was an abusive husband with drinking problem and the courts were quick to grant her sole custody of Dana.

        <br>
                
                One day when Dana arrived at her dorm adfer a class she found 2 lawyers waiting for her. They explained that they represented her father's estate. Dana tries to dismiss them but to avail. Instead they show her an envelope and informs her that her father willed her 1/3 of his estate. The lawyers then pull out some documents from the envelope and asks her to sign it.

                She hesitates to sign the documents. She feels a guilt for the abusive her mother suffered at the hands of him. The lawyers try their best to convince to accept her fortune but only pervail to a small extent. This is a very big, life changing event, what should she do? </p>
