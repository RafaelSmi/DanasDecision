                <p> Dana decides to side with her half siblings instead of the stepmother. they are her brother and sister after all and it's better if she gets allong with them. They do make her feel uncomfortable and unlike but blood is thicker than water. She didn't like that they were acting unsually nice to her just to gain her favor. Never-the-less, she decided to make the best of it and try to build a relationship with them somehow.

                Sticking togther, they were able to defeat the stepmother unanimously in court. The stepmother walked away with only the things she cam into the marriage with and the siblings were very happy. Dana was very thrilled that she was able to help them. She hoped that this would make them start to accept her and bring them all closer together as brother and sisters. On the contrary, this success inspired the half sbilings to higher ambitions. Unbeknownst to Dana, they hatched a devious plan to get her out of the will so they could get it all for themselves. Do they succeed? </p>
