                <p> Dana phones up her mother and explains the situation to her. Her mother was filled with many different emotions. They went back and forth on the decision before, carefully weighing all the pros and cons.

                If she accepted the money it could cover the rest of her expenses and she would be comfortable for the rest of her life.

What did mother decide? </p>
