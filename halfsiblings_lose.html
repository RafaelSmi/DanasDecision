                <p> Danais greedy halfsiblings' feeble atempt of robbing her of her inheritance fell flat. Now Dana is clearly aware of how truly cunning they were. She decided that they didn't deserve to be apart of her life and cut them off. They showed no remorse, they didn't even bother to apologize to Dana.

                However, all this changed when the lawyers informed them that their action forfieted them from the will. Their father was very strict and hated when his children disobeyed him, something they did quite often. He was also quite aware of how spoilt and greedy they could be and suspicious that they would find a way to swindle Dana out of her inheritance. In the will, he put a strict NO-CONTEST clause which concluded that should anyone contest his wishes, they forfeit their share to charity.

                To their horror they lost all of their inheritance, lucky for them they still have their trust fund money to live off of. However, it's no so lucky for Dana. She unknowingly disobeyed the NO-CONTEST clause, due to it being apart of the lawyer's NO-DISCLOSURE. By helping the step mother to get a share of the estate she had lose her share of the will as well.

                It didn't take long for the lawyers to inform Dana of her lost of her inheritance. Her siblings took such delight in Dana and the stepmother losing everything that they didn't even care about their lost anymore. The selfish half siblings decided to celebrate by taking a trip away on their private jet.</p>
