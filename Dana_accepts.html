                <p> Dana come to the decision to take the money. Dana goes to the lawyers and signs the papers. The weeks that follow severely changes her life. She is still adjusting to the wealth. She also learns that she has 2 half siblings. Her father had remarried twice after divorcing her mother. Her younger siblings are from the 1st marriage and their mother died years pior. They have been apart of their father's life their whole lives and got the childhood and father that she was deprived. They grew up wealthly and had everything they ever wanted. They were also very spoilt and greedy.

                She also meets her father's last wife and learns that her siblings don't take so kindly to her. They do not like there step mother. She is beautiful woman and but had only been married to their father for a couple of months. Their father had not been able to adjust his will before he died and so she got left out, much to her dismay. The siblings however, were very pleased and were not sublte in showing it.

                The stepmother is very unhappy about this situation and has gathered her lawyers and contestes the will for a share of ther estate. Dana's half siblings are completely against this. The are already displeased with having the estate be divided into 3 shares for Dana. Just as Dana didn't know about them, they were unaware of her. They had expected to be share the estate between the 2 of them and now they refuse to allow anyone else to take away anymore of their inheritance.

                This all causes a issue for Dana. She barely knows any of her sibling or the stepmother well enough to jugde but they both are requesting her support. Her stepmother is a geninuely nice person unlike her spoil siblings who consistently ignored her or gave her the cold shoulder. Now they are acting overtly friendly inordr to get what they want. Dana would love to have a good relationship with her siblings but she also feels bad for the step mother who has been left with nothing. What will she do?  </p>
