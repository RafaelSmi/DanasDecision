                <p> Dana decides to hang up her client list and take the full scholarship. She could believe how much she had hurt her mother and disappointed her by ignoring her studies for chasing rish men. She felt a little disappointed in herself aas well for not considering her mother as well. Her mother worked very hard to get her thus far, it was like a slap in the face for her to take it so lightly. She was glad she came to her senses beofe she lost her mind and all chances at a scholarship. </p>
