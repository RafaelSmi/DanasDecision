                <p> Unbeknownst to her, the money that was donated to the school was the inheritance that she refused. Her father had a clause in his will that should his kids refuse or lose their inheritance then the money should be divided and donated anominously to charities. A decent sum of which should go to the school that said child is currently attend or the last attended.

                The scholarship makes the rest of her school career a financially happy and secure. She finishes school with honor and graduates without any student debt. She never regreted her decisions, instead she just accepted that things will always work out how they were supposed to. Now she had Phd and was about to truly start her life. She was happy for all the lessons she learnt from it all and could wait to see what life held ahead.</p>
