                <p> Dana thought about that night as much as possible and made sure she got more details about her clients before meeting them.

                She would soon find out a few days later that it wasn't all behind her. It wasn't long before she received a phone call from her mother. She was extremely angry and disappointed in her daughter. It didn't take long for Dana to put make 4 and realise that her half brother had something to do with it. She should have known her awful halfsiblings would ruin everything for her once again.

Her half siblings had went on the witch hunt for her mother's contact and phoned in Dana's secert in detail. Dana to cried She din't understand how they could dispise her so without truly giving her a chance to prove herself. To make things worst her mother will never looked at her the same. She spent forever on the phone trying to smoothe the situation out but mother was truly hurt.</p>
