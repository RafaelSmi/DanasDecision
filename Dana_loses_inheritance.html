                <p> Dana lost all of her inheritance, the moeny went o a charity and Dana was back were she began. She as no money and, to make matters worse, no scholarship. When her financial situation inmproved it made in eligable for the scholarship. As a result, the university revoked it and gave to another student in more need of it. At the time Dana never had any protest but now she was in need of a scholarship to pay for college and she knew her mother could not aford it.
            
        <br>
        <br>
                Dana decided to reapply for another schalrship, hoping it would help but it was to no avail. There was no more money available in the scholarship fund and she was going to have find away to make ends meet until a scholarship became available. The problem was there was not telling how long it would take for a scholarship to come, and even it 1 did the process was 1st come 1st serve and she was 4th in line. She was in a dilemma.

                Two of her closest friends on campus decided to help her. The first friend is a  waitress at a campus restuarant that it hiring. The pay was very little and would barely make a dent in her tuition and expenses. The second friend offers to get her into a business where she could make enough money to pay off all her debts easily. She is a private escort and she makes thousand in a night from 1 date.

                Dana was very shoked to find out that her friend was an escort. She couldn't believe that this offer was even on the table but it would provide to be a more financially fruitful income. Being a waitress has integrity but low pay and becoming an escort has the money but no integrity. What will she chose? </p>
