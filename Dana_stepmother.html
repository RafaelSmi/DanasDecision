                <p> Dana decides to side with her stepmother. She was always genuinely nice and never made her feel uncomfortable unlike her new brother and sister. The stepmother is very glad to have Dana's support band drastically helps the court decision, which allowed her to keep her lifestyle prior to her husband's death. She got  to keep all the stuff acquired during the relationship including their home and all the luxuries that came with it. She even got a very decent sum as a monthly allowance.

                Dana was very happy for herself mother and was thrilled that she was able to help her out. Her half-siblings, however, were livid. The win for the stepmother, they disliked so highly, came at the thier cost. The estate was responsible for covering all these cost, which ment they were paying for this out of their inheritance. This made them even colder towards their new sister. Scorned, they hatch a plan to get her out of the will so they could be the only heirs. Do they succeed? </p>
